BAD AND MANY WOULD SAY UGLY,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
DONALD TRUMP HAS CONNECTED AND

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
HE HAS CAPTURED A MOMENT IN

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
HISTORY.
I'M CHRIS MATTHEWS.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
>>> HELLO.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'M THOMAS ROBERTS.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
THE 2016 BATTLE FOR THE WHITE

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
HOUSE IS IN FULL SWING AND, BY

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
ALL ACCOUNTS, A MOMENTOUS RACE

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
LIKE NO OTHER.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
IT WASN'T SO LONG AGO THAT THE

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
COUNTRY EXPERIENCED ANOTHER

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
HISTORIC RACE, GROUNDBREAKING

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
FOR ENTIRELY DIFFERENT REASONS.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
FOR THE NEXT HOUR, WE LOOK AT

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
THE MAN WHO WAS ELECTED IN 2008,

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
THE 44th PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
STATES, BARACK OBAMA.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
>> IF THERE IS ANYONE OUT THERE

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
WHO STILL DOUBTS THAT AMERICA IS

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
A PLACE WHERE ALL THINGS ARE

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
POSSIBLE, WHO STILL WONDERS IF

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
THE DREAM OF OUR FOUNDERS IS

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
ALIVE IN OUR TIME, WHO STILL

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
QUESTIONS THE POWER OF OUR

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
DEMOCRACY, TONIGHT IS YOUR

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
ANSWER.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
>> AFTER A GROUNDBREAKING

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
CAMPAIGN, AMERICANS GO TO THE

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
POLLS IN HUGE NUMBERS, THE

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
HIGHEST TURNOUT IN DECADES.

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
AND WHEN THE VOTES ARE COUNTED,

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
A NEW CHAPTER IN AMERICAN

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
HISTORY BEGINS.

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
>> I NEVER THOUGHT I'D LIVE LONG

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
ENOUGH TO SEE IT.

39
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
YES!

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
>> WE NEED THAT CHANGE!

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
OBAMA!
OBAMA!
>> IT SPEAKS OF US AS A NATION

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
THAT WE'RE READY TO BE FAIR, TO

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
BE OPEN AND WE FEEL BETTER ABOUT

44
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
OURSELVES, I THINK, BECAUSE OF

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
IT.

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
>> BARACK OBAMA HAS SPENT HIS

47
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
LIFE STRADDLING DIFFERENT

48
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
WORLDS.
NOW HE IS TRANSCENDING THEM TO

49
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS WHO

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
THOUGHT THEY WOULD NOT LIVE TO

51
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
SEE AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN ELECTED

52
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
PRESIDENT, HIS VICTORY IS

53
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
ESPECIALLY MEANINGFUL.

54
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
>> SOME PEOPLE GAVE THEIR VERY

55
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
LIFE TO MAKE TONIGHT POSSIBLE.

56
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I FEEL VERY BLESSED TO SEE THIS

57
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
DAY.

58
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
>> TONIGHT, WE PROVE ONCE MORE

59
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
THAT THE TRUE STRENGTH OF OUR

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
NATION COMES NOT FROM THE MIGHT

61
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
OF OUR ARMS BUT FROM THE

62
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
ENDURING POWER OF OUR IDEALS.

63
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
DEMOCRACY, LIBERTY, OPPORTUNITY

64
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
AND UNYIELDING HOPE.

65
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
>> IN THIS HOUR, THE PERSONAL

66
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
AND POLITICAL JOURNEY OF BARACK

67
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
OBAMA.

68
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
>> MORE THAN 100,000 PEOPLE

69
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
GATHERED AS ELECTION DAY 2008

70
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
UNFOLDS INTO NIGHT.

71
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
THEY LISTENED FOR WHAT MANY HAVE

72
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
SPENT A LIFETIME HOPING TO HEAR.

73
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
>> IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME COMING.

74
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
BUT TONIGHT, BECAUSE OF WHAT WE

75
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
DID ON THIS DAY IN THIS ELECTION

76
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
AT THIS DEFINING MOMENT, CHANGE

77
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
HAS COME TO AMERICA.

78
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
>> IN THE UNLIKELIEST OF

79
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
STORIES, A FRESHMAN SENATOR

80
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
BREAKS THE COLOR BARRIER TO

81
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
DEFEAT AN OPPONENT WITH DECADES

82
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
OF EXPERIENCE IN WASHINGTON.

83
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
AND FOR BARACK OBAMA, THE

84
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
HARDEST PART MAY JUST BE

85
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
STARTING

86
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
STARTING.
ON THE HEELS OF HIS MASTERFUL

87
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
CAMPAIGN, HE FACES ECONOMIC

88
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
CRISIS AND WAR ABROAD.

89
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
OBAMA FEELS THE RESPONSIBILITY

90
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
EVEN IN THE MIDST OF

91
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
CELEBRATION.

92
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
>> WE MAY NOT GET THERE IN ONE

93
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
YEAR OR EVEN IN ONE TERM, BUT,

94
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
AMERICA, I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE

95
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
HOPEFUL THAN I AM TONIGHT THAT

96
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
WE WILL GET THERE.

97
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I PROMISE YOU, WE AS A PEOPLE

98
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
WILL GET THERE.

99
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
>> BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA WAS BORN

100
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
IN 1961 IN HONOLULU, HAWAII.

101
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
THE NAME BARACK MEANS BLESSED.

102
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
IN AN INTERVIEW HE MADE IN 2004,

103
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
HE MAKES LIGHT OF HIS UNUSUAL

104
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
NAME.
>> MY FATHER IS FROM KENYA, MY

105
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
MOTHER FROM KANSAS.

106
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
PEOPLE CALLED ME ALABAMA OR YO

107
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
MAMA OR BAHAMA.

108
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
AND I THINK PEOPLE APPRECIATED

109
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
THE FACT THAT I COULD JOKE ABOUT

110
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
IT.
>> OBAMA'S PARENTS MEET AT THE

111
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII WHERE THEY

112
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
ARE BOTH STUDENTS.

113
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
THEY GET MARRIED IN 1960 BUT

114
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
SEPARATE WHEN OBAMA IS ONLY 2

115
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
AND EVENTUALLY DIVORCED.

116
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
HIS FATHER LEAVES THE ISLAND TO

117
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
ATTEND HARVARD UNIVERSITY ON A

118
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
SCHOLARSHIP TO GET HIS PH.D. AND

119
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
LEAVES OBAMA AND HIS MOTHER

120
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
BEHIND.

121
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
OBAMA WILL NOT SEE HIM AGAIN

122
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
UNTIL HE'S 10 YEARS OLD WHEN HIS

123
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
FATHER VISITS THE FAMILY FOR A

124
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
MONTH.
THEY STAY IN TOUCH BUT 11 YEARS

125
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
LATER, HIS FATHER DIES IN A CAR

126
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
ACCIDENT.
THIS VISIT IS THE LAST TIME HE

127
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
SEES HIS DAD.
IN HIS 1995 MEMOIR, "DREAMS FROM

128
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
MY FATHER," OBAMA RECALLS HIS

129
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
MOTHER GIVING HIM INSIGHT INTO

130
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
THE FATHER HE BARELY KNEW.

131
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
WHEN OBAMA IS 6 YEARS OLD, HIS

132
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
MOTHER REMARRIES AN INDONESIAN

133
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
MAN, LOLO SATERA AND THE FAMILY

134
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
SOON MOVES TO TUNISIA.

135
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
HE ADAPTS, A SKILL THAT WILL

136
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
SERVE HIM IN THE YEARS TO COME.

137
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
HIS EARLY EXPERIENCES EXPOSING

138
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
TO A MELTING POT OF RACISM IN

139
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
CULTURES.

140
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
>> I GREW UP NOT ONLY IN HAWAII

141
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
BUT ALSO IN INDONESIA.

142
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I HAVE A HALF SISTER WHO IS HALF

143
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
INDONESIAN WHO JUST MARRIED A

144
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
CHINESE-CANADIAN.

145
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I HAVE A NEW NIECE WHO HAS MY

146
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
DNA BUT LOOKS COMPLETELY

147
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
DIFFERENT.

148
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
AND SO I'M CONSTANTLY REMINDED

149
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
OF THE FACT THAT I'M CONNECTED

150
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
TO THE PEOPLE I SEE, THAT I KNOW

151
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
THEIR STORIES BECAUSE THEY ARE

152
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
MY STORY, TOO.

153
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
>> HIS MOM CHALLENGED HIM

154
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
ACADEMICALLY.

155
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I MEAN, SHE JUST WANTED HIM TO

156
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
LEARN AS MUCH AS HE COULD.

157
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
>> AT AGE 9, OBAMA'S MOTHER

158
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
SEPARATES FROM HIS STEPFATHER.

159
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
SHE MOVES THE FAMILY BACK TO

160
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
HAWAII AND OBAMA ATTENDS PUNAHO

161
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
ACADEMY.
>> HE WAS AN ALL-AROUND GUY,

162
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
VERY WELL-LIKED, RESPECTFUL,

163
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
ARTICULATE, SPOKE VERY WELL.

164
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
>> AS A TEENAGER, OBAMA EXHIBITS

165
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
HIS COMPETITIVE SIDE PLAYING

166
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
BASKETBALL AND HIS INTELLECTUAL

167
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
SIDE BY READING A VARIETY OF

168
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
BOOKS, MANY ABOUT

169
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
AFRICAN-AMERICAN LIFE FROM

170
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000

HUGHES AND ALEX HAYLEE.

173
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
BY THE TIME HE'S IN HIGH SCHOOL,

174
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
OBAMA IS STRUGGLING TO MAKE

175
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
SENSE OF HIS MULTICULTURAL

176
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
BACKGROUND.

177
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
IN HIGH SCHOOL, HE USED DRUGS

178
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
AND DRANK HIGH SCHOOL.
HE WRITES, "TO PUSH THE

179
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
QUESTIONS OF WHO I WAS OUT OF MY

180
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
MIND."
IN 1979, OBAMA LEAVES HAWAII TO

ATTE

182
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
ATTEND OCCIDENTAL COLLEGE.

183
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
IT'S A CONFUSING PART OF LIFE

184
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
BUT IT'S WHERE HIS DESIRE FOR

185
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
PUBLIC SERVICE AND HIS GIFT FOR

186

HE'S THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
TO HOLD THE POSITION.

372
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000

373
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
ELECTED OF HARVARD LAW REVIEW

374
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
AND THERE WAS PALPABLE

375
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
EXCITEMENT THAT WE WERE MAKING

376
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
HISTORY.
>> GAINING SUCH A POSITION OPENS

377
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
A LOT OF DOORS FOR OBAMA.

378
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
BUT HE RESISTS TAKING THE

379
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
CONVENTIONAL ROUTE.

380
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
>> HE COULD HAVE HAD ANY JOB IN

381
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
AMERICA.
HE COULD HAVE CLERKED FOR ANY

382
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000

HE COULD HAVE HAD THE MOST

PRESTIGIOUS PROFESSORSHIP IN THE

384
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
COUNTRY.
HE COULD HAVE GONE TO THE TOP

385
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
LAW FIRM AND MADE A PRINCELY SUM

386
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
OF MONEY AND HE AGAIN WENT BACK

387
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
TO CHICAGO AND SET DOWN HIS

388
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
ROOTS AND BUILT ON THE BASE THAT

389
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
HE CREATED AS A COMMUNITY

390
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
ORGANIZER AFTER COLLEGE.

391
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000

393
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I GUESS HE LIKED CHICAGO.

394
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I NEVER KNEW AT THAT TIME THAT

395
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
HE DID HAVE IN THE BACK OF HIS

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
MIND GETTING INVOLVED MORE

397
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
POLITICALLY AS AN ELECTED

THE COMMUNITY.

403
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
BUT THERE'S MORE TO OBAMA THAN

404
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
BUILDING HIS RESUME.

405
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
AT THE SAME TIME, HE'S GETTING

406
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
SETTLED IN HIS PERSONAL LIFE.

407
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000

CHRIST, WHERE OBAMA FINDS A

410
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
SPIRITUAL HOME.
IN 1995, OBAMA'S MOTHER DIES OF

411
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
OVARIAN CANCER.
IT HAPPENS JUST A MONTH AFTER

412
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
OBAMA PUBLISHES HIS VERY

418
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
ABOUT THE BOOK IS I THINK CAN

419
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
CAPTURES ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

420
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
IS EXTRAORDINARY ABOUT HIM AND

421
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
THAT IS THAT HE'S A CONFLUENCE

422
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
OF A LOT OF DIFFERENT STRAINS OF

423
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000

HIS EXTENSIVE GRASSROOTS

428

429
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
VOTED IN BY A SIZEABLE MAJORITY.

00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
RUSH IN THE DEMOCRATIC

551
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
CONGRESSIONAL PRIMARY.

552
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING.

553
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
>> HE LOSES BADLY.

554
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
>> HE WAS A LITTLE BIT TOO

555
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
INTELLECTUAL IN HIS SPEECHES AND

556
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I THINK HE LEARNED THAT POLITICS

557
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
IS MORE ABOUT CONNECTING WITH

558
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
PEOPLE THAN SHOWING THEM HOW

559
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
SMART YOU ARE.
>> THERE WAS A NUMBER OF US WHO

560
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
SAID TO HIM THAT MAYBE THIS

561
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
WASN'T THE RIGHT IDEA AND WE

562
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
WERE PLAYING CARDS THAT NIGHT

563
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
AND NOBODY REALLY WANTED TO SAY

564
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
ANYTHING.

565
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
AND BARACK JUST LOOKED UP AND HE

566
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
SAYS, ALL RIGHT, I KNOW YOU ALL

567
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
WANT TO SAY IT, DON'T SAY IT.

568
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
AND IT'S OVER.
AND WE ALL LAUGHED AND THAT WAS

569
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
THE END OF IT.

570
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
>> JOKING ASIDE, OBAMA IS SO

571
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
DEFLATED HE CONSIDERS DROPPING

572
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
OUT OF POLITICS ALTOGETHER.

573
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
IT ONLY GETS WORSE AFTER THE

574
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11th.

575
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
OBAMA IS ALREADY AT A POLITICAL

576
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
LOW POINT.

577
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
IT DOESN'T HELP THAT HIS NAME

578
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
SOUNDS AN AWFUL LIKE --

579
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
>> OSAMA BIN LADEN.

580
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
>> I HEARD COMMENTS ABOUT

581
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000

582
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
EVERYTHING, SOME MEMBERS EVEN

583
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
CALLED HIM THAT AND EVERYTHING,

584
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
WHICH I RESENTED THEM DOING THAT

585
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
TO HIM BASED ON HIS NAME.

586
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
>> THE UNITED STATES MILITARY

587
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
HAS BEGUN STRIKES AGAINST AL

588
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
QAEDA TERRORIST TRAINING CAMPS

589

THE TALIBAN REGIME IN

591
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
AFGHANISTAN.
>> AT FIRST, OBAMA, LIKE MUCH OF

592
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
THE COUNTRY, RALLIES BEHIND THE

593
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
BUSH'S ADMINISTRATION TO TAKE

594
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
OUT THE TALIBAN BUT A YEAR LATER

595
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
WHEN IT BECOMES CLEAR THAT THE

596
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
PRIORITY HAS SHIFTED TO EYE

597
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
BEI

598
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
IRAQ, OBAMA IS OPPOSED.

599
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,000
>> WHAT I DO OPPOSE IS A DUMB

600
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
WAR.

601
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
WHAT I DO OPPOSE IS A RASH WAR.

602
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
>> TO MARCH INTO AN UNNECESSARY

603
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
WAR WHEN ALMOST THE ENTIRE

604
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
COUNTRY, YOU KNOW, IS BEHIND IT,

605
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I MEAN, YOU HAVE TO HAVE GUTS TO

606
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
DO THAT.

607
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
>> AT 41, BARACK OBAMA IS ACHING

608
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
MORE THAN EVER TO RUN FOR

609
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
NATIONAL OFFICE WHEN ILLINOIS

610

SENATOR PETER FITZGERALD

611
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
ANNOUNCES HE'S VACATING HIS SEAT

612
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
IN APRIL 2003, OBAMA JUMPS ON

613
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
THE OPPORTUNITY.
>> I WILL BE A CANDIDATE FOR THE

614
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
UNITED STATES SENATE IN 2004.

615
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
>> I REMEMBER I WALKED INTO HIS

616
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
OFFICE AND HE SAID I'VE GOT

617
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
SOMETHING TO ASK YOU AND I SAYS,

618
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
WHAT'S THAT?

619
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
AND HE SAID, I'M THINKING OF

620
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
RUNNING FOR U.S. SENATE.

621
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
WOULD YOU SUPPORT ME?

622
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
AND I SAID, YES.

623
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
AND HE LOOKED AT ME IN A PUZZLED

624
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
LOOK AND HE SAYS, DON'T YOU HAVE

625
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,000
TO THINK ABOUT IT FOR A WHILE?

626
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
AND I SAID, NO, NOW YOU'RE READY

627
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
AND IT'S THE RIGHT RACE.

628
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
>> BUT BEFORE OBAMA CAN WIN THE

629
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
GENERAL ELECTION, HE'S GOT TO

630
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
WIN A TOUGH PRIMARY.

631
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
HIS OPPONENTS ARE FORMIDABLE.

632
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
>> AS THESE TWO WHITE CANDIDATES

633
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
AT THE TOP OF THE TICKET WERE

634
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
KIND OF DUKING IT OUT OVER THE

635
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
WHITE VOTE, HE JUST RACES RIGHT

636
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
BY THESE TWO AT THE END.

637
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
THEY WERE LIKE THE TWO HORSES IN

638
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
FRONT BUTTING HEADS AGAINST ONE

639
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
ANOTHER AND OBAMA JUST RACES

640
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
RIGHT BY THEM.

641
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
>> ON PRIMARY DAY IN MARCH 2004,

642
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
A STUNNING VICTORY.

643
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
>> WE GET THIS SEAT FOR THE

644
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
DEMOCRATS IN NOVEMBER.

645
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
>> AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S

TOP GUNS SUDDENLY START TO TAKE

647
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
NOTICE.
>> I WENT OVER TO TALK TO HIM

648
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
AND THERE WAS A LOT OF NATIONAL

649
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
ATTENTION FOR A GUY WHO WASN'T

650
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
EVEN A U.S. SENATOR AT THAT

651
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
POINT.
>> WINNING CAN PUT YOU ON THE

652
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
RADAR AND OBAMA ALL OF A SUDDEN

653
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
WAS WINNING WHEN HE WASN'T

00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
SUPPOSED TO AND A LOT OF

655
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
DEMOCRATS WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING

656
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
FROM A DISTANCE WANTED TO SIZE

657
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
THIS GUY UP, FIND OUT WHAT HE'S

658
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
ALL ABOUT, IS HE GOING TO

659
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
CHALLENGE US ALL THE WAY TO THE

660
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
TOP.
>> OBAMA HASN'T EVEN WON THE

661
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
U.S. SENATE SEAT WHEN HE

662
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
RECEIVES AN INVITATION HE

663
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
WOULDN'T HAVE DREAMT OF EVEN A

THERE'S BUILDING ANTICIPATION

735
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
ABOUT A YOUNGER, LESS FAMILIAR

736
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
DEMOCRAT FROM ILLINOIS SET TO

LITTLE BIT SLOW.

741
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
>> ON BEHALF OF THE GREAT STATE

742
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000

743
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000

AMERICA HAS A PLACE FOR HIM,

747
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,000
TOO.
>> THEN THE AUDIENCE GETS INTO

748
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
IT.

749
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
>> HOPE -- HOPE IN THE FACE OF

750
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
DIFFICULTY.

751
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
HOPE IN THE FACE OF UNCERTAINTY.

752
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000

00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
>> IT'S GETTING STRONGER AND

754
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
STRONGER AND STRONGER.

755
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000

POLITICAL DARKNESS, A BRIGHTER

758
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
DAY WILL COME.

759
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY.

760
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
GOD BLESS YOU.

761
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
>> AND THE TEARS WERE ROLLING

762
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
DOWN MY EYES.

763
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
>> WE WERE ALL CRYING.

764
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
WE FELT SO GOOD.

765
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
BARACK HAD TOLD US BEFORE, DON'T

766
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
WORRY, I'LL DO ALL YOU GUYS

767
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
PROUD, AND HE DID.

768
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
>> HERE COMES THIS GUY WHO

769
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
NOBODY HAD HEARD OF BUT HAD A

770
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
LOT OF BUZZ AROUND HIM AND HE

771
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,000
HIT THE BALL OUT OF THE PARK.

772
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
>> OBAMA RETURNS HOME CONFIDENT

773
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
AND MORE DETERMINED THAN EVER TO

774
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
WIN A SEAT IN THE U.S. SENATE.

775

INVESTMENT BANKER JACK RYAN,

777
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
WITHDRAWS FROM THE RACE.

778
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
HIS CAMPAIGN DERAILED BY A SEX

779
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
SCANDAL.

780
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS

781
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
SCRAMBLING TO FIND A CANDIDATE,

782
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
EVEN OFFERING THE JOB TO

783
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
LEGENDARY CHICAGO BEARS COACH.

784
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
>> THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HERE IN

785
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
ILLINOIS WAS JUST IN A SHAMBLES

786
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
AT THIS POINT.
THEY COULDN'T FIND A CANDIDATE

787
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
TO RUN AGAINST THIS GREAT NEW

788
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
HOPE OF THE DEMOCRATS.

789
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
THEY THOUGHT, WE REALLY NEED TO

790
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
PUT SOMEBODY IN THERE AND MUDDY

791
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000

792
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000

THE RACE IS SHORT BUT

799
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
CONTENTIOUS.
KEYS ACCUSES OBAMA OF

800
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
CRITICIZING THE BUSH

801
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000

POSITION ON ABORTION.

805
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
>> CHRIST WOULD NOT VOTE FOR

806
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
BARACK OBAMA BECAUSE BARACK

807
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
OBAMA HAS VOTED TO BEHAVE IN A

808
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
WAY THAT IT IS INCONCEIVABLE FOR

809
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
CHRIST TO HAVE BEHAVED.

810
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
>> BARACK JUST STAYED ABOVE THE

FRAY AND RAN A MORE POSITIVE

812
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
CAMPAIGN BASED ON THE ISSUES.

813
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
>> YES, WE CAN.

814
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
>> OBAMA WINS BY A LANDSLIDE

815
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
RACKING UP 70% OF THE VOTE, THE

816

RECONSTRUCTION.

826

HIS SHOE WHOSE CAR BARELY RAN

828
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
WHO IS JUST FULL OF IDEAS.

829
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
THIS WAS JUST THE MOST EXCELLENT

830
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
ADVENTURE.

831
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
>> ONCE IN WASHINGTON, OBAMA

832
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
SETS OUT TO MAKE HIS MARK BUT AS

833
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
A FRESHMAN SENATOR AND WITH THE

834
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
REPUBLICANS IN CONTROL, HIS

835
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
IMPACT IS LIMITED.

836
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
>> OBAMA IS VIEWED BY OTHER

837
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
SENATORS AS AN OUTSIDE PLAYER,

838
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
SOMEONE WHO HAS A REAL ABILITY

839
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
TO CAPTIVATE THE MEDIA BUT

840
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
INSIDE THE BACK ROOMS OF THE

841
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
SENATE WAS NOT MUCH OF A FACT

842
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
ARE TO.

843
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
>> AND I THINK HE FOUND THAT

844
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
PRETTY FRUSTRATING THAT HE COULD

845
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
DO A WHOLE LOT MORE THAN HE

846
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
COULD DO IN WASHINGTON.

847
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
>> BUT OUTSIDE THE SENATE

848
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
CHAMBER, OBAMA IS INCREASINGLY

849
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
SEEN AS A PASSIONATE ADVOCATE

850
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
FOR THE LESS FORTUNATE.

851
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000

WHAT AMERICA CAN DO WHEN WE COME

856
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
TOGETHER NOT A SYMBOL FOR WHAT

857
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
WE CAN'T OR WON'T DO.

858
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
>> OBAMA'S WORK EXTENDS BEYOND

859
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,000
AMERICA'S BORDERS, TRAVELING TO

860
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000

CRITICIZE THE BUSH

A GROWING NUMBER OF WASHINGTON

888
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
INSIDERS START TO THINK OBAMA

889
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
LOOKS MORE LIKE A PRESIDENTIAL

890
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
CANDIDATE THAN A JUNIOR SENATOR

891
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000

that blazes the path to
your passions?

1144

Years of devastating cutbacks

30,000 teachers laid off.

1169

OBAMA.
THAT WAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOCK

1213
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
DOWN THIS NOMINATION.

1214
